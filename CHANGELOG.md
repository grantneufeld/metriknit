# Change history for Metriknit

## Version 0.0.1

* Copy of source files from other project (turning a metrics script within a project into this separate gem).
* Itâ€™s embarassing that there are no specs yet. This is just a quick-n-dirty release. My only consolation is that this is a development-only tool and not for use in production.
